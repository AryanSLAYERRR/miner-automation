##  Overview

Miner Automation streamlines browser-based Monero mining by:

- Using Playwright for automated browser control.
- Logging in via Gmail OTP (through Gmail API).
- Opening multiple tabs to mine with a safe JavaScript keep-alive script.
- Delivering notable hash rates (~700â€“800 H/s per tab).
- Injecting commands and cleaning inbox emails.
- Designed around XMRig CC from Bendr0id.

> **Paused:** Mining functionality currently doesn't work. A workaround is in progress.

##  Features

- **Auto-login** using Gmail OTP (via Gmail API).
- **Multiâ€‘tab mining** (configurable count).
- **Safe keep-alive** with JS: scrolling, focusing, input events.
- **Terminal command injection** via browser UI.
- **Gmail cleanup** to manage inbox clutter.
- Approx. **700â€“800 H/s per tab**, depending on resources.
- **Planned enhancements**: inactivity detection, config optimization, improved hashrates.

---

##  Requirements

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Playwright**
- **Gmail API credentials** (`credentials.json`)
- Google API packages:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client                    google-auth-httplib2                    google-auth-oauthlib
  ```
- **Playwright browser binaries** (via `playwright install`).

---

##  Setup

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AryanSLAYERRR/miner-automation.git
   cd miner-automation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   playwright install
   ```

3. **Set up Gmail API** (gives the script access to your Gmail â€” use an alternate/test account recommended):
   - Go to Google Cloud Console â†’ Create a new project.
   - Enable the **Gmail API**.
   - Create **OAuth 2.0 credentials** (set type = Desktop app).
   - Download and rename file to `credentials.json`, placing it in the project root.

4. **Configure command and credentials**:
   - Edit `command.txt` and paste your mining command, including your Monero wallet address.
   - In `main.py`, set `"your_email"` to match the one used for the Gmail API.

---

##  Usage

```bash
python gmailcode.py
```

- Youâ€™ll be prompted to authorize via a browser.
- If you encounter access errors, update your Google Cloud project's OAuth consent screen:
  - Add your testing email under **API & Services â†’ OAuth consent â†’ Test Users**.
  - Retry.
- On success, you'll receive a `token.json` file.

Then run:

```bash
python main.py
```

- Chrome should launch via Playwright, performing mining automation.

**Optional config**: adjust `num_tabs` for parallel mining â€” avoid exceeding ~90% RAM to prevent system instability.

Monitor progress on [Nanopool](https://nanopool.org) by searching your wallet address.

##  Keep-Alive Mechanism

To keep terminal sessions alive without pushing keystrokes, the injected JS:

- Scrolls the page slightly up and down.
- Focuses on the hidden input.
- Dispatches an `input` event.

##  Project Structure

```
miner-automation/
â”œâ”€â”€ gmailcode.py        # Gmail OTP handler
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py             # Core automation logic
â”œâ”€â”€ command.txt         # Mining command with wallet info
â”œâ”€â”€ credentials.json    # Downloaded Google OAuth credentials
â”œâ”€â”€ token.json          # Generated after Gmail authorization
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt

##  Security Notes

- Your Gmail credentials (credentials.json, token.json) are stored locally.  
- **Never share them.**  
- Avoid using accounts with 2FA unless using app passwords.
